ðŸ§® Calculator â€“ Program Description
This is a fully functional web-based calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The HTML defines the layout of the calculator, including the number buttons (0â€“9), operation buttons (+, â€“, Ã—, Ã·), a clear button (C), and an equal button (=).

CSS is used to style the calculator interface, giving it a clean, modern look. It includes responsive design techniques to ensure usability on both desktop and mobile screens.

JavaScript handles the logic of the calculator. It listens for button clicks, updates the display dynamically, and evaluates expressions using built-in functions or custom parsing.

The calculator keeps track of user inputs, updates the screen in real time, and handles errors like division by zero. It's a great beginner-to-intermediate project to strengthen skills in event handling, DOM manipulation, and dynamic UI updates.
